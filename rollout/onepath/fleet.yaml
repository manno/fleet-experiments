rolloutStrategy:
  # A number or percentage of clusters that can be unavailable during an update
  # of a bundle. This follows the same basic approach as a deployment rollout
  # strategy. Once the number of clusters meets unavailable state update will be
  # paused. Default value is 100% which doesn't take effect on update.
  # default: 100%
  maxUnavailable: 100%
  # A number or percentage of cluster partitions that can be unavailable during
  # an update of a bundle.
  # default: 0
  maxUnavailablePartitions: "1"
  # A number of percentage of how to automatically partition clusters if not
  # specific partitioning strategy is configured.
  # default: 25%
  autoPartitionSize: 10%
  # A list of definitions of partitions.  If any target clusters do not match
  # the configuration they are added to partitions at the end following the
  # autoPartitionSize.

    - name: prod
      # A number or percentage of clusters that can be unavailable in this
      # partition before this partition is treated as done.

      maxUnavailable: 90%
      # Selector matching cluster labels to include in this partition
