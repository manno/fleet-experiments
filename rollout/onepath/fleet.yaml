rolloutStrategy:
  # A number or percentage of clusters that can be unavailable during an update
  # of a bundle. This follows the same basic approach as a deployment rollout
  # strategy. Once the number of clusters meets unavailable state update will be
  # paused. Default value is 100% which doesn't take effect on update.
  # default: 100%
  maxUnavailable: 100%
  # A number or percentage of cluster partitions that can be unavailable during
  # an update of a bundle.
  # default: 0
